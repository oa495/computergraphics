		<h2> Assignment #0 </h2>
		<p>I got really interested in 3D Graphics on the web when I happened upon the Chrome Experiments page sometime last year. Chrome Experiments is a showcase of web experiments and hacks written by the creative coding community. I found a tutorial on Getting Started with WebGL on the web but I didn't have enough knowledge about the subject to just jump into it. Luckily, I found three.js. After looking through the examples and featured projects I started playing around with the library a little bit. The creator of three.js mentioned his aim was to create a 'lightweight 3D library with a low level of complexity - in other words, for dummies.' While I like the idea of making such a powerful tool more approachable to people, I wasn't satisified being one of those 'dummies' so I decided to take this class to get a more in depth understanding of the subject. I think that way when I am using a library like three.js, it won't feel all like magic and I will be better at figuring out when/why things go wrong. </p>

		<p>I want to be able to make more interactive applications for the web that respond to various stimuli - maybe like sound or movement and that are experiences in and of themselves. </p>

		<p> I would like to be able to use a Javascript library such as yume.js or three.js sometime in the class when I have a better understanding of them. Some other things I'm interested in are lighting, transformations, interactions with the models and maybe some animations.</p>
