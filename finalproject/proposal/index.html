		<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
		<p>For my final project I want to make a game using Unity or three.js. The game will feature a lot of 3D shapes scattered all around the environment. Each shape will be created with its own speed and will be positioned randomly along the y axis. The objective is to make sure none of the shapes get to the "ground" and explode. </p>
