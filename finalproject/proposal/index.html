		<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
		<p>For my final project I want to make a visualization using three.js. The power of 3D Graphics on the web is that you're able to use it along with the tons of other things the web gives you access to - data, video, chats, sound. I'm would like to do either a sound or data visualization where the shapes on the screen respond to music or are representative of numbers/data in some format. </p>
